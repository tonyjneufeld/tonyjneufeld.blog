title:  "I have a problem with Hacker News"  
---

Okay, well actually, I love [**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com/news).

It’s clean, fast, and full of incredibly smart people. I personally learn something every time I visit. It is a goddamn goldmine for the tech industry. It’s free, and it feels like it hasn’t changed in years. For me, as someone who despises social media, it feels like the perfect online community.

But… I am not a hacker, and sometimes I feel like I don’t quite fit in.

I work in **business operations**, specifically RevOps, and this space is not discussed on Hacker News. Things like GTM strategy, tech stack, sales compensation models, revenue, data analytics, etc., just don’t get discussed here.

I like tech, I like data, and I even enjoy writing code in my spare time. But on Hacker News, most of the conversations fly right over my head — or just aren’t relevant to the work I do daily.

So, where do I go?

* LinkedIn? It feels like it is AI-generated, primarily garbage, you have to filter out a lot of noise, and there are constant sales pitches.

* Slack communities / RevOps Co-op / Wizards of Ops? Great people, but chaotic and impossible to search without subscriptions.

* Reddit? Too much noise, and the signal dies fast. Nobody goes here in my space.

## Here’s what I want to build:

- A place where the newest trends in the industry are being discussed and rise to the top.  
- A place for the most intelligent people in Business Ops, RevOps, CS Ops, Marketing, Sales, and GTM teams to share what they’re learning and struggling with.  
- A place where people talk about real problems in Business Oeperations.  
- A public, searchable, lightweight site that isn’t trying to addict me, sell me something, or optimize for virality. Hacker News, but for **Ops nerds**.

I want:

- **Simplicity** — no clutter, no vanity metrics.  
- **Quality** — real people with real problems and real ideas.  
- **Ad-free and algorithm-free** — just good conversation, out in the open.

This isn’t a startup. I’m not trying to raise money or get acquired. I just want this thing to exist for the kind of people I work with every day.

So I’m building it. I'm going to purchase the domain, and when I do I’ll call it [**opsnews.io**](http://opsnews.io). I even had lovable.dev put together an mvp for me, here is the [**dream**](https://ops-whisper-network.lovable.app/).

It’s my MVP of what I think the internet is missing for business-minded builders like me.

Suppose this resonates with you, cool. Stay tuned for more.  
If it doesn’t — that’s cool too.

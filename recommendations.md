## My Favourite Books

These are the books that influenced my approach to money, work, and life. And before you go and buy any of them, go get them for free from your local library!

### Fiction

- *And Then There Were None* by Agatha Christie — A quick read, and one of my favourite mysteries.
- *Lord of the Flies* by William Golding — Another quick read, but an absolute classic.
- *1984* by George Orwell — Incredibly relevant for today's day and age.
- *The Shining* by Stephen King - I didn't sleep for a couple weeks after this one.
- *The Way of Kings* by Brandon Sanderson - An incredible journey, this book is long, but completely on another level.

- *Your Money or Your Life* by Vicki Robin — A mindset reset on how we exchange life energy for money.
